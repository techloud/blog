    <p>techloud is a data&shy;driven assistance tool for your online shopping research. There's so much information available out there: social platforms, blogs, forums, comments, articles, and many more. At any given moment, there are thousands of new reviews published. It's impossible to keep track on all of them on your own, and it can be frustrating even just to try. It's time consuming, exhausting, and confusing.</p>
<p><br />The idea behind techloud was to develop a technology that can collect all this data and analyze it &shy;doing all the hard work for you, so you could keep track easily over the crowd sentiment. We crawl through major online marketplaces and retailers in real&shy;time, staying always up to date on all the recent products and prices. Our mission is to make your shopping experience simple and enjoyable, and allow you to save time and money. We are excited to see the techloud community growing and we are working diligently to improve continuously and pursue our mission. Stay tuned!</p>
